                    Her mastery of the “science” of communication and the established methodologies that are available to people for producing prompt
                    and sustainable results enables her to teach clients specific strategies they can use to remove personal obstacles  and  achieve
                    their personal goals.<br>
                    <br>
                    She is a graduate of Anthony Robbins Mastery University, an intensive program taught by some of the most accomplished business
                    teachers and “doers” in the world.  Mastery University provides a method of learning from various masters in their fields about
                    their strategies for success and their own experiences with failure and life’s learning lessons; saving many from decades of trial
                    and error experiences in attempting to achieve the results they want. Impressed by the results from the Robbin’s programs,
                    Ms. Settembrino pursued further studies with Dr. Clare Graves work with “Spiral Dynamics." This methodology uses a psychosocial
                    scale to ascertain the belief system an individual uses so one can better predict that individual’s behavior. She further studied
                    the neurotechnology on which much of the Tony Robbins programs are based, which led to two Master certificates of Neuro Linguistics
                    and Neuro Strategies and also two Master certificates of Hypno-Therapy. Mary Ann also worked for Anthony Robbins as an executive
                    coach in his partnership with Chet Holmes. Mary Ann Settembrino is also a physician of Chinese medicine who specializes in integrated
                    and functional medicine. She and her husband started one of the first integrated medical centers in Philadelphia in 1995.<br>

                    Al Pierce has been designing custom sporting goods products and selling them throughout the United States for decades.
                    He began creating and manufacturing protective sports equipment for his own start up company in the late eighties.
                    Playing college football at the University of Arizona, he took notice of the business of sports and sporting goods.
                    After college he designed a series of products that featured nearly 2 dozen patented and trademarked items for a number of
                    sports including football, basketball, baseball, softball, soccer and others. Overtime, he sourced 100’s of manufacturing
                    facilities throughout Asia, the Far East and South America.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Al also oversaw the sales of his unique sporting goods products along with a variety of professional sports licensed items
                    which included NFL, MLB, NASCAR and COLLEGIATE licensed sports products. Customers included national and regional retail chains
                    along with a majority of the major professional sports teams. Many items enjoyed national exposure among NFL teams and
                    top professional athletes, Collegiate teams and several Olympic teams. Retail customers included mass merchants such as  Walmart,
                    Target, Kmart and Toys R US and regional and national sporting goods chains such as Modell’s, Academy, Big 5, MC Sports and
                    Dicks Sporting Goods.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    As the result of being the founder and owner of a small multi-million dollar business, Mr. Pierce acquired a wealth of experience
                    managing all aspects of business operations. He is perhaps best known for his sales and marketing capabilities in addition to being
                    known as a creative designer, a problem solver, and a leader that thinks outside the box.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    These various business experiences and world travels have taught Mr. Pierce much about how different cultures and various businesses
                    operate and work. All having the common denominator of personal growth through self reliance and self awareness, along with perpetual
                    improvement. Traits he hopes to bring to the Camden Leadership Academy.
